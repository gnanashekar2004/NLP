## **Assignments**  

### **1. Assignment 1: Enhancing Emotion Recognition Using POS Tagging**  
- **Objective**: Improve emotion recognition in text using Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging.  
- **Description**:  
  - Perform POS tagging on the text data and analyze its impact on emotion recognition.  
  - Implement TF-IDF vectorization on POS tags and explore how it enhances classification performance.  
  - Evaluate the model on training, validation, and test sets.

### **2. Assignment 2: Text Summarization Using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**  
- **Objective**: Build and evaluate a Seq2Seq model for text summarization using RNNs.  
- **Description**:  
  - Perform exploratory data analysis on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset to understand its structure.  
  - Preprocess the text data (tokenization, padding, and vocabulary creation).  
  - Implement a Seq2Seq model with an optional attention mechanism to generate summaries.  
  - Train the model on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset and evaluate using ROUGE scores.  
  - Test the trained model on a new Wikipedia dataset for generalization.

### **3. Assignment 3: Hate Speech Classification Using Few-shot Prompting**  
- **Objective**: Classify problematic statements into three categories using zero-shot and few-shot prompting with the Flan-T5 model.  
- **Description**:  
  - Leverage the Flan-T5 model (small and base) to classify statements as **Normal**, **Hatespeech**, or **Offensive**.  
  - Experiment with zero-shot and few-shot settings for classification.  
  - Perform prompt engineering and analyze its impact on performance.
